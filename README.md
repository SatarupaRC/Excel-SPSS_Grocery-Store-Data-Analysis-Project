# Grocery Store Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

A small local grocery has seen a decline in sales in the past few months. The owner has made no changes to the store in the last year. In the beginning, the owner thought the sales drop might be seasonal. However, looking at the sales data for the past few years, the owner noticed that there had not been any decrease in sales during the same time in the previous years. Thus, the owner is unsure of the reason behind the decline. 

   The primary objective of the research is to identify and evaluate the customer’s perception regarding different store-related factors such as customer service, cleanliness, promotions offered, the products, and customer safety and test if these factors are significant determinants of customer satisfaction and the no. of items customers purchase. The secondary objective of this research is to identify the main customer segment that visits the store using demographic profiling. Finally, based on the results of the analyses, a strategic solution would be provided to the store that would potentially increase the sales.


In the next section we start by developing the research questions and hypotheses and discussing the rationale behind them. Following this we discuss the research method and the data analyses. In this section we elaborate on the data collection methodology and how the different attributes were measured. Next, we provide details of the data analysis along with the tools used for our analyses in the same section. Finally, we provide recommendations based on our findings, discuss the limitations of the research and future research objectives.

## Conceptual Development


For a store to understand its customer base well, it needs to identify the customers that visit the store more than others, i.e., identify the target customer segment (Jolaoso 2024). One common way of segmenting the market is via demographic profiling (Appinio GmbH, 2023). In demographic segmentation the data is grouped into categories based on multiple demographic variables. The target group is generally decided based on size or purchasing power. Thus, the first step in our research process would be identifying the store’s target segment based on Gender, Ethnicity, and Income of the respondents (Yieldify, 2020). Formally stating we are interested in the following research question:

**RQ1**: What is the largest segment that visits the store most often?

Customers base their satisfaction and preference for shopping at a store based on multiple store-related attributes (Daultani et al., 2021). The primary attributes that affect a customer’s perception of a store are customer service, cleanliness, safety, promotions, products, and prices (Church, 2022; Zygiaris et al., 2022). Favorable evaluations of these attributes increase the customer’s intention to visit the store, repurchase intentions, and customer satisfaction (Daultani et al., 2021). On the other hand, negative perceptions regarding these attributes can result in a significant decrease in sales and a lower chance of customers visiting the store. For example, Aldousari and El-Sayed (2017) found that a higher perception of the cleanliness of the store and product quality were the primary factors driving the decision to select a store. Similarly, Hu et al. (2009) find that delivering high-quality customer service can increase customer satisfaction. Thus, it is important to identify the attributes that are evaluated by the customers so that we can devise strategies to enhance customer evaluation of these attributes and increase sales. Our second research question can formally be stated as follows:

**RQ2**: Does the customer’s perception regarding customer service, cleanliness, product, safety, and satisfaction with the store different from neutral?


A customer’s awareness or familiarity with the different promotions offered at the store can significantly affect their intentions to purchase and the number of items they purchase at the store. Customers show a much higher chance of purchasing a product as the discount goes up (Razy & Lajevardi, 2015). Research shows that loyal customers are more prone to use online promotions over traditional newsletters (Zhang & Wedel, 2009). Also, Gen X, Y, and Z are more likely to use online marketing promotions above printed promotions, while Baby Boomers are more prone to use printed promotions (Williams & Page, 2011). Thus, a lack of knowledge of the different promotions and the website can significantly reduce sales. The store needs to make sure that customers are aware of both the printed promotions and the store website where the online promotions are offered. Formally stated, we are interested in finding the following:

**RQ3**: Does the customer’s familiar with the store website and the different forms of promotions (online and offline) offered by the store different from neutral?


Customer satisfaction is the biggest predictor of sales performance of a store (Gómez et al. 2004). As stated earlier, customer satisfaction has been shown to vary based on customer’s evaluation of the different attributes such as customer service, cleanliness, prices offered at the store compared to their competitors, quality of the product, and safety (Church, 2022; Zygiaris et al., 2022). The more highly customers evaluate these attributes, the more they are satisfied with the store, and the higher the chance they will purchase more items and return to the store in the future (Wasko, 2021; Chinn, 2022). Also, today’s customers (Gen X, Y, and Z) are digitally savvy, and thus, the more familiar they are with the store’s website and the different online promotions, the more they will shop at the store and purchase more items (Shopify, 2023). Formally, we can hypothesize the following based on the above discussion:

**H1**: The higher the i) perceptions of customer service, cleanliness, and safety, and ii) better the evaluation of price and products offered at the store, and iii) more familiarity the customers are with the website and promotions offered at the store, the more would be the customer satisfaction.

**H2**: The higher the i) perceptions of customer service, cleanliness, and safety, and ii) better the evaluation of price and products offered at the store, and iii) more familiarity the customers are with the website and promotions offered at the store, the more items customers would purchase at the store.

Research shows that perceptions of different attributes vary across gender and sex groups. For example, women have a greater fear of being a victim of crime compared to men (Tandogan & Ilhan, 2016). Similarly, women have a higher benchmark for safety and cleanliness than men and prefer shopping at stores that rate high on safety and cleanliness (Sehib et al., 2013). Also, women put more weight on relational aspects of service quality, such as helpfulness or behavior of the staff, than men (Sánchez-Hernández et al., 2010). Thus, comparing the differences in perception across attributes such as customer service, cleanliness, product prices and quality, safety, and their familiarity with online and offline promotions, can provide us insight regarding the differential evaluation of these attributes across gender groups and, in turn, help the store identify differential targeting strategies for each group across specific attributes that could enhance evaluation and lead to higher sales. Comparing the evaluation of the attributes across the income and ethnicity of the customers can also provide better targeting insights. For example, it is expected that higher-income customers would prioritize the quality of the product, service quality, and cleanliness of the store, compared to the price of the product and the promotions available at the store, while those with lower income would place more importance on the price and promotions offered at the store compared to cleanliness and service quality. Furthermore, similar differences in attributes have also been observed across different ethnic groups in past research. For example, Bristow and Asquith (1999) found that Hispanics give more importance to the price and quality of the product (for hedonic products) than non-Hispanic Caucasians. Thus, it is important for the grocery store to know if there are differences in perception regarding these attributes across gender, income, and ethnic groups to devise targeting strategies and identify if there are certain groups that are more dissatisfied than others. We can formally state it as follows:

**RQ4**: Perceptions of service quality, cleanliness, prices, product selection, safety, and satisfaction vary across different gender, income, and ethnic groups.

**RQ5**: Familiarity of online and offline promotions will vary across different gender, income, and ethnic groups.

## Research method and data analysis

### Research method:

Psychometric scales were developed to measure customer perceptions regarding the following attributes at the grocery store: 

1.	Customer service
2.	Cleanliness
3.	Product quality, selection, and prices
4.	Safety
5.	Customer satisfaction

The scales for customer service, cleanliness, and customer satisfaction included a measure for overall perception and more specific measures regarding the attribute. For example, for cleanliness perception, a measure of customers' overall perception of cleanliness was included along with customer's cleanliness perception regarding the store's restrooms and the inside of the store. Measurements were also created to measure customers' awareness of the grocery store's website and the online and offline promotions offered by the grocery store. All the variables were measured on seven-point Likert-type scales. Data was also collected regarding the Gender, Ethnicity, Age, and Income of the respondents, along with the no. of items bought at the store by the respondents. The scales, along with the measures used, are provided in Table 1 below.

An online survey based on the questionnaire elaborated above was created to collect the data. At the checkout counters of the grocery store, customers were asked to respond to an online survey after they checked out. The decision to do an online survey was made because of the low response rate associated with printed surveys. Also, customers are generally in a hurry to leave the store most of the time and do not like spending time completing a printed survey at the location. However, they could take an online survey at their own time. A convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data owing to the inherent difficulty of using any probability sampling technique, due to the need for the sampling frame to be available.

The customers who agreed to participate were sent a unique link that took them to the online survey designed on Qualtrics. For completing the survey, the respondents were offered an incentive of 10% off on their next purchase with a maximum discount of $5 for participating in the survey. To make sure that they responded to the questions and did not skip them. The questions were set to 'force response' under 'requirements.' Two attention-check questions were also added to filter out respondents who did not pay attention. Furthermore, multiple 'security' options on Qualtrics were enabled to prohibit 'duplicate responses' and 'bots' from completing the survey. Finally, at the end of the survey, the respondents were redirected to an external link that provided a coupon with a unique QR code, which they would need to redeem the incentive.

**Results**:
Microsoft Excel and SPSS were used for the data analyses. Before conducting the main analyses, the quality of the data was assessed. Fourteen respondents were found to have failed the attention check questions. These participants were removed before progressing to the main analyses. The final sample comprised of 120 (Males = 40%, Female = 40%, and Others = 20%; MeanAge =44.13) respondents. The majority of participants comprised of Hispanics (53.3%), followed by Others (14.17%), African Americans (13.33%), Asians (3%), and Non-Hispanic whites (9.17%). There was a pretty consistent distribution of Income ranges in the sample, with all groups having a representation above 17% and less than 22% in the sample. A further analysis revealed that within the Hispanic population while gender and income is more or less consistently distributed across the different groups, age is not. Gen Y (between 30 to 44 years) and Z (between 12 to 29 years) make up 76.6% of these customers. Pie charts, created in Excel, in Figure 1A and 1B below illustrate the distribution of gender and ethnicity in the sample and Figure 1C provided a bar chart for the distribution of Income. Table 2 provides the age distribution for Hispanic customers.

To test RQ1, identifying if there is an association between the different categorical variables: Gender, Income, and Ethnicity, we conducted a chi-square analysis for the test of independence across 1) Gender and Income, 2) Gender and Ethnicity, and 3) Ethnicity and Income on SPSS. There was no significant relationship between Gender and Income, and Ethnicity and Income (p<.01). However, there was a significant relationship between Gender and Ethnicity (χ^2 = 24.62, p<.01). Since eight of the cells had expected frequency less than ‘5’ we also looked at the likelihood ratio which was also significant (LR = 27.72, p<.01). Table 3 below provides only the SPSS outputs for significant chi-square analyses results.

Next, to see if there was a significant difference in customers’ perception of the store’s service, cleanliness, safety, product selection, satisfaction, and awareness of the website and promotions offered at the store, from a neutral point (RQ2-RQ3), we conducted one-sample t-tests against the midpoint of the scale ‘4.’ We found that customers felt that the store and its restroom’s are clean (p<.01). Also, customers were familiar with the promotions offered on the newsletter, perceived the store’s product selection and the quality of the product at the store to be better than the competitors, and were willing to come back at the store (p<.01). However, customers perceived the store’s customer service to be poor and employees to be not helpful (p<.01). Customers also did not feel safe at the store (p=.04) or at the parking lot (p=.06). Furthermore, the consumers were not familiar with the website and the online promotions offered at the store (p<.01). Table 4 below provides the SPSS outputs for the one-sample t-test analyses.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c151996f-37b5-43ec-b9c1-199089d1ecd4)

To test Hypotheses H1 and H2 we ran regression analyses using SPSS. To test H1 we conducted a linear regression analysis with overall customer satisfaction as the dependent variable and customer’s overall service and cleanliness perceptions, perception of safety at the store and the parking lot, quality and prices of products, and familiarity with store website and offline and online promotions as the independent variables. For testing H2, we changed the dependent variables to the number of items bought at the store but retained the same independent variables. The overall regression model for testing H1 was significant (F (9,110) = 2.85, p<.01, R2adjusted = .12). Further inspection revealed that customer perception regarding overall service offered at the store (B = .21, t = 2.4, p =.02) and safety at the parking lot (B = .24, t = 2.21, p =.03) were significant predictors of customer satisfaction. The regression model for testing H2 was significant as well (F (9,110) = 3.85, p<.01, R2adjusted = .18) and prices offered at the store (B = 2.15, t = 4.4, p <. 01)  and how safe customers felt while shopping at the store (B = 1.17, t = 2.33, p =.02) significantly predicted the no. of items customer bought during their visit at the store. Table 5A below provides the SPSS outputs for the regression analyses with customer satisfaction as the dependent variable while Table 5B shows the outputs with number of items bought as the dependent variable.

Finally, we compared the customers’ perception regarding service quality, cleanliness, prices, product selection, safety, satisfaction, and familiarity with online and offline promotions , satisfaction at the store across the different gender, ethnic and income groups (RQ4-RQ5) using ANOVA analyses on SPSS. We found a significant difference in overall cleanliness perceptions, familiarity with online and newsletter promotions, and prices offered at the store across the different gender groups (p<.01). Post-hoc analyses revealed that Males and females perceived the store to be cleaner than the ‘others’ group (p<.01) but ‘others’ were more familiar with the ‘online promotions’ compared to males and females (p<.01). However, the ‘others’ group is less familiar with the newsletter promotions offered at the grocery store compared to female customers. Also, the ‘others’ group perceived the prices at the grocery store to be lower than both male and female customers (p<.01). Other than these, male customers feel less safe parking their cars in the parking lot compared to their female counterparts (p=0.42). Next, we found significant differences in cleanliness perceptions of the store, familiarity with online and offline promotions, and quality and prices of the products at the store across the different ethnic groups (p ≤.05). Post-hoc analysis revealed further insights regarding these differences. Hispanics perceive the store to be significantly cleaner (p<.01) and are less familiar with online promotions (p<.05) than all other ethnic groups. However, Hispanics are more familiar with newsletter promotions than both Asians and African Americans and rate the quality of product to be higher than Asians (p<.01). Also, Hispanics feel that the prices offered at the store are much higher than Asians, African Americans and, the others group (p<.05). We did not find any significant difference across the variables for different income groups (P>.05). Table 6A below provides the SPSS outputs for ANOVA analysis with gender as the independent variable, 6B is for ethnicity as the independent variable, and 6C is for Income as the independent variable. For brevity, the post-hoc tests are not provided.

## Recommendations, limitations and future research

The grocery store has been suffering from decreased sales over the last few years without making any significant changes. The primary goal of this research is to identify some of the potential factors that might be causing the decrease in sales. The secondary goal is to provide implementable solutions that would remedy these problems and increase sales.

Our findings show that the primary customer group visiting the store are Hispanics with an average age of 37.6, and Gen Y (between 30 to 44 years) and Z (between 12 to 29 years), making up 76.6% of these customers. These customer groups mainly prefer online promotions. However, the results show that the customers at the store are hardly familiar with the website or the online promotions. This especially applies to the largest group of customers (the Hispanics) who are more familiar with the printed newsletter than with the online promotions. Thus, the store needs to invest in its website and increase awareness among customers regarding its online promotions. One way to do that might be to provide a QR code on the receipt that takes the customer to the weekly promotions page of the website. Also, providing online-only promotions where customers need to scan a QR code from the online promotion page may nudge customers to become familiar with the website. Other than these, hiring a social media marketing specialist might help them reach the customer base, considering that the main customer base is Gen Y and Z, who regularly use social media websites such as Instagram and X. The social media marketing specialist can potentially enhance the online presence and help the store reach a wider audience.

Another area that needs attention is the consumer’s perception of prices offered by the store. Not only were the prices perceived to be higher than the competitors, but they were also found to have a significant effect on the number of items bought by the customers. While reducing prices might not be easy, considering this is a local store and not a big chain, the store can offer weekly promotions that might help ease the feeling of higher prices.

 The other two aspects that need attention are customer service and safety perceptions. Both of these attributes showed lower averages than a neutral perception. Also, both of these attributes were significant predictors of customer satisfaction (safety at the parking lot and coverall customer service) and the number of items bought by customers (how safe they feel at the store). For customer service, making the employees go through customer service training programs can help. Customers’ safety concerns can be mitigated by hiring a security guard and by putting more cameras in the store and in the parking lot. Also, providing more lighting in the parking lot can help with safety concerns.

While the analysis provides preliminary insights, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the analysis. First, the data was collected across a particular week during the month. It is possible that collecting the data during different times of the month (beginning and end) might provide more insight regarding the customer base. Also, the sample size used was not that big, considering we focused on segmentation and profiling the customer base. Future research should plan to collect a larger and more robust data dataset and use advanced profiling and segmentation methods such as K-means cluster analysis, etc. Finally, it might be a good idea to do a follow-up survey with the same measures after implementing the measures based on our recommendation and compare the results with the current data set. This will confirm if, indeed, our recommendations led to better evaluations of the attributes and have increased sales.
